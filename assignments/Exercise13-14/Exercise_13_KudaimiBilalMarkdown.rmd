##A: Summary of the model

```{r model-code, echo = FALSE}

setwd("C:/Users/PS3ma/Documents/GitHub/dsc520")

library('foreign')
library('tidyverse')

#Importing data and changing the dependent variable column to binary
ThoraricSurgery <- read.arff("data/ThoraricSurgery.arff")
ThoraricSurgery$Risk1Yr = 1*(ThoraricSurgery$Risk1Yr == "T") + 0

#Generating our model for Risk1Yr based on all other variables
model <- glm(formula = Risk1Yr  ~  DGN + PRE4 + PRE5 + PRE6 + PRE7 + PRE8 + PRE9
             + PRE10 + PRE11 + PRE14 + PRE17 
             + PRE19 + PRE25 + PRE30 + PRE32 
             + AGE, data = ThoraricSurgery,  family = binomial())

#Summary of our model
summary(model)

#According to the z-statistics from the summary, the variables PRE9, PRE14OC14,
#PRE17,and PRE30 had the greatest effect on the survival rate.

#Predicts the probability of the patient surviving for more than a year after surgery
model_probabilities <- fitted(model)

#Defining each probability as either a 1 or 0 based on a cutoff of 50%
#65% was found to maximize the accuracy of this model, but 65% doesn't make sense.
#Would a probability of 60% mean someone is not likely to survive past a year? 
#This is why 50% was chosen here.
model_pred <- 1*(model_probabilities > 0.5) + 0

#Defining an accuracy vector where each 1 represents the prediction matching the actual data
accuracy <-  1*(model_pred == ThoraricSurgery$Risk1Yr)

#Calculates percent accuracy by dividing the sum of the match vector by the
#number of rows in the data set then multiplying by 100
percent <- (sum(accuracy)/nrow(ThoraricSurgery)) * 100
percent

#This model has an accuracy of 83.62%, meaning this model can accurately predict
#the likelihood of surviving a year after surgery 83.62% of the time
