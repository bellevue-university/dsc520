## Assignment
**Fit a logistic regression model to the binary-classifier-data.csv dataset from the previous assignment.**

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Question A:
**What is the accuracy of the logistic regression classifier?**

## Answer for A:
```
The accuracy came out to be 58.34%
```


```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE} 
setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/dsc520")
binary_df <- read.csv("data/binary-classifier-data.csv")

binaryClassifier_df <- read.csv("data/binary-classifier-data.csv")

#Logistic regression model
binaryClassifier_glm <- glm(label ~ x + y, data=binaryClassifier_df, family = binomial)

summary(binaryClassifier_glm)

res_val <- predict(binaryClassifier_glm, type="response")

bcPredictionData <- table(Actual_Value = binaryClassifier_df$label, Predicted_Value = res_val > 0.5)

bcPredictionData

dataModelAccuracy <- (bcPredictionData[[1,1]] + bcPredictionData[[2,2]]) / sum(bcPredictionData)

dataModelAccuracy

```


## Question B. 
**How does the accuracy of the logistic regression classifier compare to the nearest neighbors algorithm?**

## Answer for B:
```
The accuracy of the logistic regression classifier as compared to the nearest neighbors algorithm is 
96.66% with 37 nearest neighbors comparison
```

```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE} 
library(class)
# Splitting the  binary classifier data in 80-20 ratio, 20 to train and 80 to test
binaryClassifier_split <- sample(1:nrow(binaryClassifier_df), 0.8 * nrow(binaryClassifier_df))
trainds <- binaryClassifier_df[binaryClassifier_split,]
testds <- binaryClassifier_df[-binaryClassifier_split,]

trained_dataset <- binaryClassifier_df[binaryClassifier_split,1]
test_dataset <- binaryClassifier_df[-binaryClassifier_split,1]

# Applying k nearest neighbour algorithm
knnTestprediction <- knn(trainds,testds,cl=trained_dataset,k=37)
confusionMatrix <- table(test_dataset,knnTestprediction)
confusionMatrix

modelaccuracy <- (confusionMatrix[[1,1]] + confusionMatrix[[2,2]]) / sum(confusionMatrix)
modelaccuracy
# model accuracy with 37 neighbors

```


## Question C:
**Why is the accuracy of the logistic regression classifier different from that of the nearest neighbors?**

## Answer For C
```
KNN :- K-nearest neighbor works/predicts as per the surrounding datapoints (K). KNN is lazy execution and can be applied to non-linear solutions, due to this it provides better accuracy than logistic regression

Logistic Regression :- It works with algebraic calculation for best fit curve for the complete population. it is linear regression with some non-linear activation function at the end to covert the regular/continuous output into different classes.
