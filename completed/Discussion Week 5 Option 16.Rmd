This week I will be attempting to explain Binomial distribution, to do this it would be helpful to at least know what that is. For this I turn to Wikipedia:
“In probability theory and statistics, the binomial distribution with parameters n and p is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent experiments, each asking a yes–no question, and each with its own Boolean-valued outcome: success (with probability p) or failure (with probability q = 1 − p)”
While that gives a good definition, I think we can trim that down a bit to get a better idea of what we really want to know. “is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent experiments, each asking a yes-no question, and each with its own Boolean-valued outcome.” It’s still a bit wordy but is a bit easier to understand when separated out like this. The formula looks like this.

Basically, as StatisticsHowTo.com points out, a binomial distribution can represent anything you can think of that can only be a success or failure. Some examples include a new drug to cure a disease, either it cures it or it doesn’t; Buying a lottery ticket, either you win or you don’t or Asking someone out, they’re either going to say yes or no (understanding this would have made high school a little better).

In this weeks reading, we were presented with the R function rbinom(), which we are able to use to generate a random sample for the binomial distribution. Though as explained, it is not simply generating random numbers but rather generating the number of successes of independent trials.

```r{17.4, echo=FALSE}

library(ggplot2)
binomData <- data.frame(Successes=rbinom(n=10000, size=10, prob=.3))
ggplot(binomData, aes(x=Successes)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=1)

```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
